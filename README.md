# KARMA Token Contract

The KARMA Token Contract is a basic implementation of a token contract on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows for the creation, management, and destruction of tokens.
## Description

The KARMA Token Contract is a Solidity program that enables the creation of a custom token, KARMA, with the abbreviation KAR. The contract has public variables to store the token's name, abbreviation, and total supply. It also includes a mapping of addresses to balances, allowing for the tracking of token ownership. The contract provides two main functions: mint and burn. The mint function increases the total supply and adds tokens to a specified address, while the burn function decreases the total supply and removes tokens from a specified address.


## Getting Started

### Installing

To use the KARMA Token Contract, you'll need to:

* Download the contract code from this repository
* Paste it in the remix ide or something similar that can compile and deploy solidy contracts. 
* Deploy the contract
* Execute the functions. 

### Executing program

To interact with the KARMA Token Contract, you'll need to:

Use the remix IDE or some other platform that can compile and deploy the solidity contract you have written and execute the mint and burn functions.


## Help

If you encounter issues with the contract, check the following:

Ensure that you have the correct contract ABI and address
Verify that you have sufficient gas to execute the desired function
